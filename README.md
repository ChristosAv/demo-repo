#Demo

This project is a representation of a cinema. It resemples a tour of a custom in a virtual place which is a cinema block.
By block I mean the cashier, where you buy tickets. The brochure where you can see what movies are availiable. The mini bar
where you can buy consumables to take  with your when you watch the movie

The code is in C# and does not include a database. Its up to the programmer to build it, according to the needs of its
program!
